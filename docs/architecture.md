# Anvil Architecture

The Anvil framework is composed of three primary layers:

1.  **The Crucible**: A static benchmark exam to test foundational knowledge across a wide range of subjects.
2.  **The Forge**: An interactive simulation engine to test agentic planning, strategy, and adaptation.
3.  **The Strikeboard**: A human-in-the-loop platform where validated agents can propose solutions to specified real-world challenges.
