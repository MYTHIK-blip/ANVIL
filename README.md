# í´– Anvil Framework

An agentic framework and benchmark for testing AI capabilities in complex reasoning, strategic simulation, and real-world problem-solving. Built on the Crucible, Forge, and Strikeboard architecture.

## Architecture
- **/anvil_crucible**: Layer 1 - A static, HLE-style knowledge benchmark.
- **/anvil_forge**: Layer 2 - A dynamic, interactive simulation environment.
- **/anvil_strikeboard**: Layer 3 - A human-in-the-loop interface for real-world problem proposals.
